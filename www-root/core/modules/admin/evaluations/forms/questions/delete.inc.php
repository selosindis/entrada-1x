 * 200	There were no errors, everything was deactivated successfully.
 * 400	Cannot delete question becuase no id was provided.
 * 401	Cannot delete question because quiz could not be found.
 * 402	Cannot delete question, because it's in use.
 * 403	There were errors in the delete SQL execution, check the error_log.
