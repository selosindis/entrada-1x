<!-- "Policy Evaluation" section of privacy policy -->
<span class="content-subheading">Policy Evaluation</span><br />
Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 will evaluate this policy's compact policy whenever it is used with a cookie. The actions IE will take depend on what privacy level the user has selected in their browser (Low, Medium, Medium High, or High); the default is Medium. In addition, IE will examine whether the cookie's policy is considered satisfactory or unsatisfactory, whether the cookie is a session cookie or a persistent cookie, and whether the cookie is used in a first-party or third-party context. This section will attempt to evaluate this policy's compact policy against Microsoft's stated behavior for IE6.
<br /><br />
<b>Note:</b> this evaluation is currently experimental and should not be considered a substitute for testing with a real Web browser.
<br /><br />
<b>Satisfactory policy</b>: this compact policy is considered <em>satisfactory</em> according to the rules defined by Internet Explorer 6. IE6 will accept cookies accompanied by this policy under the High, Medium High, Medium, Low, and Accept All Cookies settings.
